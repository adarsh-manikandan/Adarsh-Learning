## Projects

### 1. Bouncing Balls Physics Simulation

A simple physics simulation of bouncing balls using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. The simulation features:

- Zero gravity environment
- Realistic elastic collisions between balls
- Mass-based physics (larger balls have more inertia)
- Momentum conservation
- Slight friction for realistic energy loss
- Smooth animations

#### Features

- Black background with vibrant colored balls
- Different sized balls with proportional mass
- Ball-to-ball collision detection and response
- Wall collision detection
- Centered canvas display

#### How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Watch the physics simulation in action!

#### Technologies Used

- HTML5 Canvas
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS3
